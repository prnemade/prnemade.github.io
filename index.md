## Research Interests Summary
My group is broadly focused on the development, characterization, and application of advanced materials, especially nanomaterials and graphene derivatives, for catalytic, environmental, and electrochemical applications. 

1.	**Membrane development:** 
My research group work on membranes focuses on developing mixed-matrix membranes that incorporate graphene oxide (GO) and other hydrophilic additives to enhance water permeability, antifouling properties, and contaminant selectivity. We work on integrating functionalized graphene materials into membranes for high-performance applications such as nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and dye removal, addressing critical challenges in treating seawater, brackish water, and industrial wastewater. A key aspect of our work is overcoming the flux-rejection trade-off, where increased permeability often compromises rejection efficiency. We aim to enhance stability in aqueous environments, ensure long-term operational reliability, and achieve superior performance in diverse water treatment applications. 

2.	**Green catalysis and photocatalysis:** 
Our research emphasizes the synthesis of functionalized graphene oxide and advanced nanocomposites for catalytic applications, including oxidation and heterocyclization. A primary focus lies in exploring reaction mechanisms and enhancing catalyst recyclability under mild and sustainable conditions. Additionally, efforts are directed toward intensifying  photocatalysis for environmental remediation by developing metal-doped and heterojunction photocatalysts for the efficient degradation of dyes, pollutants, and chromium reduction. Material modifications are employed to optimize photocatalytic performance under solar and UV light, contributing to sustainable chemical processes and addressing environmental pollution challenges. 

3.	**Sustainable materials development:** 
We also work valorization of biomass, such as waste banana pseudo stems, highly invasive water hyacinth, to produce bioactive compounds, cellulose derivatives, and efficient adsorbents. Efforts include synthesizing hydrophobic cellulose-based materials for applications in oil-water separation, packaging, and stain-resistant fabrics. The work emphasizes circular economy principles and sustainable waste biomass management, promoting eco-friendly solutions and resource efficiency. 
Additionally, we fabricate multifunctional materials with emphasis on improving hydrophilicity, structural strength, and environmental resistance for use in effluent treatment, desalination, and separation processes, contributing to innovative and sustainable solutions for environmental and industrial challenges.

4.	**Advanced adsorption technologies:** 
Our research group have developed high-capacity adsorbents, such as graphene-based sponges and covalent triazine frameworks, for the removal of heavy metals like Cr(VI) and dye pollutants. Their work includes a detailed investigation of adsorption kinetics and mechanisms, emphasizing electrostatic interactions and ion exchange to optimize performance and efficiency. 

5.	**Nanostructured materials for energy storage:** 
We have designed hyperbranched graphene-based electrodes, waste tyre char, cellulosic composites for supercapacitors, enhancing charge storage capacity and cycle stability. Structural modifications are explored to optimize ion mobility and reduce resistance, improving the efficiency and performance of energy storage systems. 

The central theme of the research is to leverage novel material designs and sustainable practices to address critical challenges in environmental management, clean energy, and resource efficiency.
